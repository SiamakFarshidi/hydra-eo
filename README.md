Hybrid Machine Learning for **Multi‑Stressor Crop Disease and Pest Detection** using **hyperspectral + thermal** sensing, **radiative transfer models (RTMs)**, and **multi‑scale Earth Observation (EO)** (UAV → airborne → satellite).

This repository hosts the open materials of the ESA HYDRA‑EO concept: code, data schemas, docs, and the scientific roadmap.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

HYDRA-EO is designed to advance crop stress monitoring through a hybrid framework that integrates radiative transfer modeling, machine learning, and multi-sensor EO data. The core objectives are:

1.  **Detect and attribute multiple stressors** (biotic and abiotic) affecting crops, including diseases, pests, drought, and heat stress.
2.  **Integrate multi-scale EO observations** from UAVs, airborne campaigns, and satellites (Sentinel-2, PRISMA, EnMAP, FLEX, CHIME) into a harmonized monitoring system.
3.  **Develop and validate hybrid algorithms** that couple RTMs (PROSAIL, SCOPE) with machine learning for retrieving vegetation traits and stress indicators.
4.  **Deploy open workflows and datasets** within ESA’s **Agriculture Virtual Lab (AVL)** and **EarthCODE**, ensuring reproducibility, open science, and community adoption.
5.  **Support ESA mission preparatory activities** by generating synthetic datasets, sensor intercomparison studies, and science roadmaps relevant for future EO missions.

## 📦 Key Outputs

HYDRA-EO delivers open and reproducible resources that can be directly reused by the EO and crop science community:

-   **Synthetic Datasets**: PROSAIL and SCOPE-based look-up tables (LUTs), trait inversion experiments, and multi-sensor resampled reflectance libraries (Sentinel-2, PRISMA, EnMAP, CHIME, FLEX, ECOSTRESS).
-   **Shiny Applications**: Interactive tools for trait–reflectance exploration, NDVI/SIF analysis, and classification workflows, accessible through the `apps/` folder.
-   **Notebooks & Tutorials**: R Markdown and Python notebooks for hyperspectral/thermal data processing, radiative transfer simulations, and hybrid ML workflows (`notebooks/`).
-   **Reusable Scripts**: Core R and Python functions for data preprocessing, sensor harmonization, and ML model training (`scripts/`).
-   **Scientific Roadmap**: Documentation of methodological advances, validation strategies, and ESA mission preparatory contributions (`docs/` + `routemap/`).
-   **Open Science Integration**: Workflows packaged for ESA’s **Agriculture Virtual Lab (AVL)** and datasets published on **EarthCODE** with FAIR metadata and DOI assignment.

## 🌱 Radiative Transfer Modeling in HYDRA-EO

The HYDRA-EO project builds upon two in-house R packages developed and maintained by the team, which form the backbone of the synthetic simulations used in this repository:

### 🔹 [ToolsRTM](https://gitlab.com/caminoccg/toolsrtm)

ToolsRTM is a comprehensive R package for structural radiative transfer modeling at canopy level. It supports PROSAIL and other 1D RTM simulations, enables the generation of look-up tables (LUTs), and allows band resampling to different sensors such as Sentinel-2, PRISMA, EnMAP, and CHIME.

The package also includes utilities for computing vegetation indices, BRF, and sensitivity analyses, along with Shiny applications for interactive trait–reflectance exploration.

### 🔹 [SCOPEinR](https://gitlab.com/caminoccg/scopeinr)

SCOPEinR is an R implementation of the SCOPE model for functional radiative transfer modeling. It simulates photosynthesis, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF), gross primary production (GPP), canopy temperature, and transpiration.

SCOPEinR links physiological traits with reflectance and flux measurements and integrates meteorological drivers from flux towers. It also provides Shiny applications for interactive exploration of functional traits and outputs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Together, **ToolsRTM + SCOPEinR** allow HYDRA-EO to generate **synthetic datasets** that couple **structural (reflectance)** and **functional (photosynthesis, SIF)** signals, providing a robust foundation for algorithm validation, stress detection, and multi-sensor data integration in the ESA monitoring framework.

### Manuals

The manuals are accessible through the [Shiny app](https://carlos-camino.shinyapps.io/0-toolsrtm-simulator/) or directly within the [ToolsRTM](https://carlos-camino.shinyapps.io/0-toolsrtm-simulator/_w_ef4421a7/Notebooks/R/ToolsRTM/ToolsRTM.html) and [SCOPEinR](https://carlos-camino.shinyapps.io/0-toolsrtm-simulator/_w_ef4421a7/Notebooks/R/SCOPEinR/SCOPEinR.html) packages. Vignettes are currently under development.
