# Methods overview

HYDRA‑EO integrates **radiative transfer models (PROSAIL, SCOPE)** with **machine learning** to retrieve plant traits and detect multi‑stressor impacts from hyperspectral and thermal data across scales.

**Key components**
- Spectral bandset reduction & sensor harmonization (UAV → PRISMA/EnMAP → CHIME).
- SIF integration & thermal‑evapotranspiration coupling.
- Trait‑driven ML: use RTM‑derived priors and simulators for robust training.
